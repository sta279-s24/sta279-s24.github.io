**Instruction:** Work with a neighbor to answer the following questions. Solutions will be posted on the course website. To get started, download the [class activity template](https://sta279-f23.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture_1_template.qmd) file.

## The birthday problem

Suppose we have a class of 30 students. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday?

* Assume there are 365 days in a year
* Assume that each day is equally likely as a birthday
* Assume there are no multiple-birth siblings (e.g. twins, triplets, etc.) in the class

1. Create a vector, `days`, to store the days of the year (numbered 1 to 365)

2. Use the `sample` function to randomly choose birthdays for the class (shared birthdays are possible, so use `replace=TRUE` in the function!)

3. Check the number of distinct birthdays (hints: `unique` returns the unique elements of a vector; `length` returns the length of a vector). Are there 30 distinct birthdays?

4. Use a `for` loop to repeat the experiment $n_{sim} = 10000$ times, making sure to store the results. What is the probability of at least one shared birthday?

5. Repeat the simulation with different class sizes. How many students do we need for the probability of a shared birthday to be approximately 50%?
