**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor to answer the following questions, then we will discuss the activity as a class. To get started, download the [class activity template](https://sta279-s24.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture_6_template.qmd) file.

## What will happen?

For each question, predict what will happen when the code is run. Then run the code and check whether your prediction was correct.

1. 

```{r, eval=F}
x <- 10

g02 <- function(x){
  x <- x + 1
  return(x)
}

g02(x)
x + 1
```

2.

```{r, eval=F}
x <- 10

g02 <- function(x){
  x <- x + 1
  return(x)
}

x <- g02(x)
x + 1
```

3. 

```{r, eval=F}
g02 <- function(y){
  y <- y - 1
  return(y)
}

g02(g02(20))
```
